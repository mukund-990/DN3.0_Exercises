Time Complexity Comparison:
Linear Search Algorithm :The time complexity of the linear search algorithm is O(n), 
where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because the algorithm iterates through each element
in the array until it finds the target element or reaches the end of the array.
Binary Search Algorithm :The time complexity of the binary search algorithm is O(log n),
where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because the algorithm divides the search space in half 
with each iteration, reducing the number of comparisons needed to find the target element.

Algorithm Suitability:
Based on the time complexity analysis, the binary search algorithm is more suitable for large datasets 
because it has a lower time complexity. However, there are some considerations to keep in mind:

Preconditions: Binary search requires the array to be sorted, which can be a significant overhead if the array is 
not already sorted. Linear search does not have this requirement.
Cache Performance: Binary search can perform poorly if the array is very large and does not fit in the cache, 
leading to poor cache locality. Linear search can perform better in this scenario.
Implementation Complexity: Binary search is generally more complex to implement than linear search, especially for beginners.

However, if the dataset is small or the array is not already sorted, the linear search algorithm may be a better choice due to its simplicity and ease of implementation.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the binary search algorithm is generally more suitable for large datasets due to its lower time complexity. 
However, the choice of algorithm ultimately depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the platform, 
including the size of the dataset, the need for sorting, and the complexity of implementation.
