Time Complexity Analysis:
Add Operation :The time complexity of the add operation is O(1), because it simply adds an employee to the end of the array.
Search Operation :The time complexity of the search operation is O(n), where n is the number of employees in the array. 
This is because the algorithm iterates through each employee in the array to find the matching employee ID.
Traverse Operation :The time complexity of the traverse operation is O(n), where n is the number of employees in the array. 
This is because the algorithm iterates through each employee in the array to print their details.
Delete Operation :The time complexity of the delete operation is O(n), where n is the number of employees in the array. 
This is because the algorithm iterates through each employee in the array to find the matching employee ID, 
and then shifts all subsequent employees down by one position.

Limitations of Arrays:

Arrays have several limitations that make them less suitable for certain use cases:
Fixed Size: Arrays have a fixed size that must be specified at the time of creation. This can lead to wasted memory 
if the array is not fully utilized, or to errors if the array is too small to hold all the data.
Inflexible: Arrays are inflexible data structures that do not support dynamic insertion or deletion of elements. 
This can make it difficult to implement algorithms that require frequent insertion or deletion of elements.
Linear Search: Arrays require linear search algorithms to find specific elements, which can be slow for large datasets.

Arrays are suitable for use cases where:

Fixed Size: The size of the dataset is fixed and known in advance.
Random Access: The algorithm requires random access to elements in the dataset.
Cache Efficiency: The algorithm requires efficient use of cache memory to improve performance.
Simple Implementation: The algorithm requires a simple and straightforward implementation.
In general, arrays are a good choice when the dataset is small and fixed, and the algorithm requires random access to elements. 
However, for larger datasets or algorithms that require frequent insertion or deletion of elements, other data structures 
such as linked lists or trees may be more suitable.
