Time Complexity Analysis:

Add Operation :The time complexity of the add operation is O(n), where n is the number of tasks in the linked list. 
This is because the algorithm iterates through each task in the linked list to find the last task and add the new task to it.
Search Operation :The time complexity of the search operation is O(n), where n is the number of tasks in the linked list. 
This is because the algorithm iterates through each task in the linked list to find the matching task ID.
Traverse Operation :The time complexity of the traverse operation is O(n), where n is the number of tasks in the linked list. 
This is because the algorithm iterates through each task in the linked list to print their details.
Delete Operation :The time complexity of the delete operation is O(n), where n is the number of tasks in the linked list. 
This is because the algorithm iterates through each task in the linked list to find the matching task ID and delete it.


Linked lists have several advantages over arrays for dynamic data:

Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow or shrink dynamically as tasks are added or deleted, whereas arrays have a fixed
size that must be specified at the time of creation.
Efficient Insertion and Deletion: Linked lists can insert or delete tasks at any position in the list, 
whereas arrays require shifting all subsequent tasks down by one position, which can be slow for large datasets.
No Wasted Memory: Linked lists do not waste memory by allocating space for tasks that are not yet added, 
whereas arrays may allocate space for tasks that are not yet added, which can lead to wasted memory.
Flexible Data Structure: Linked lists can be used to implement a variety of data structures, such as stacks, queues, 
and trees, whereas arrays are limited to a single data structure.

However, linked lists also have some disadvantages, such as:

Slower Search: Linked lists require iterating through each task in the list to find a matching task ID, 
which can be slower than arrays for large datasets.
More Memory Usage: Linked lists require more memory to store the pointers between tasks, 
which can lead to increased memory usage.
In general, linked lists are a good choice for dynamic data that requires frequent insertion or deletion of tasks, 
whereas arrays are a good choice for static data that requires fast search and access.
