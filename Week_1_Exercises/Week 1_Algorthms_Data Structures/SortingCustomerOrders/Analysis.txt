Time Complexity Comparison:
Bubble Sort Algorithm The time complexity of the Bubble Sort algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. 
This is because the algorithm uses two nested loops to iterate through the array, resulting in a quadratic time complexity.
Quick Sort Algorithm The time complexity of the Quick Sort algorithm is O(n log n) on average, where n is the number
of elements in the array. This is because the algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort the array, 
resulting in a logarithmic time complexity.

Quick Sort is generally preferred over Bubble Sort for several reasons:

Faster Performance: Quick Sort has a faster time complexity than Bubble Sort, making it more suitable for large datasets.
Efficient Use of Memory: Quick Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, which means it does not require additional memory 
to sort the array. Bubble Sort, on the other hand, requires additional memory to store the temporary swaps.
Stability: Quick Sort is a stable sorting algorithm, which means it preserves the order of equal elements. 
Bubble Sort is not stable, which can lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios.
Scalability: Quick Sort is more scalable than Bubble Sort, making it suitable for large datasets and parallel processing.

However, there are some scenarios where Bubble Sort may be preferred over Quick Sort:

Small Datasets: For small datasets, Bubble Sort may be faster than Quick Sort due to its simplicity and low overhead.
Simple Implementation: Bubble Sort is easier to implement than Quick Sort, making it a good choice for educational 
purposes or simple sorting tasks.
In conclusion, Quick Sort is generally preferred over Bubble Sort due to its faster performance, 
efficient use of memory, stability, and scalability. However, Bubble Sort may be suitable for small datasets or 
simple sorting tasks where simplicity and ease of implementation are more important than performance.
